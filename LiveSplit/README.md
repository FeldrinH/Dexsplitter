# LiveSplit autosplitter

This is a LiveSplit autosplitter for Ambidextro with premade splits for running the Any% category.

You can download the splits for the Any% category [here](./Ambidextro%20-%20Any%25.lss) (click the download button in the top right corner). The autosplitter will be automatically downloaded and installed when opening the splits in LiveSplit. You can enable it by opening the 'Edit Splits' window and clicking the button labeled 'Activate'.

The autosplitter has the following features:

* Reads in-game speedrun timer for the most accurate time (make sure that LiveSplit is set to use game time).
* Automatically splits at the end of a level (before the level transition, if there is one).
* Automatically starts run when speedrun timer starts ticking.
* Automatically resets run when (re)starting level 0.
